### Design Thinking Project:
 
<p align="justify"> This project applies the Design Thinking methodology, a human centered and solution focused approach to solving real world challenges. Under the theme ‚ÄúBig Data and Artificial Intelligence New Innovation,‚Äù our team explored the growing difficulties individuals face in managing personal finances amid rising inflation and increasing cost of living. The result is FinAI, a mobile application designed to help users track expenses, manage budgets, set savings goals, and receive bill alerts using AI powered insights. The project focuses on practical, secure, and user friendly financial management supported by intelligent data. </p>
                  

Below is a brief overview of our project journey through each phase of the Design Thinking process, along with visuals of our work at each stage.


1. <b>Empathize Phase</b> </br>
We conducted interview and survey to understand user pain points in personal finance management.</br>

### My Reflection on SECP1513-Technology and Information System Course

<p align="justify"> 

This course has given me a comprehensive introduction to Information Systems and Technology, both in theory and practice. Throughout the semester, I engaged in various assignments that deepened my understanding of core IT concepts. The jigsaw activity on computer hardware chapther helped me understand  to computer hardware and system in a collaborative way.

I also explored different types of Operating System and their applications through open-ended assigment in Chapter 3-software, which enhanced my critical thinking and digital literacy.
    
The most impactful part of the course was the series of industry talks, where I created posters, participated as a presenter, and gained real insights into the ICT job market, required industry skills, managing burnout in tech, and the future of Generative AI. These sessions helped me connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications.

Finally, the Design Thinking project allowed me to apply what I learned by developing an AI-based solution for personal finance management. This experience strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking skills.

Overall, the course helped me better understand the IT field and inspired me to explore career opportunities in the tech industry. </p>
